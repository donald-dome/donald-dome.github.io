(BIT), I live in Dar-es-salaam by the time though my hometown is Mwanza. tall, Slim, African color, brown eyes and Kind of ...... yap thats it.\r\n\r\n### Programming\r\nI started my programming life neatly on August 07 2015, I could say i started ealier but as far as i can remember, that was the first time i felt motivated to code, by the time i had some programming knowledge on C an d some Java but was not that much motivated, I was working as am intern worker at A Christian Company called World Vision Korogwe branch, I had Co-workers who were web designers the most inspiring were Hongero Hassan and Jane Njau who together gave me the passion to start exploiting the Web Technologies, Hongero was writting PHP an d together with Jane we stated bits by bits studying the web technologies, the tags, the elements and the attributes, hope you understand.... \r\n\r\nI started off with HTML and CSS by Duncan, the book explained the concepts just as I wanted it to be, It took me time though to master it, I then took a step up and studied different books and websites on CSS3, and lastly started to learn HTML5.\r\n\r\nAs I entered the HTML5 world I found a whole new world of web technology, The JavaScript things in it were a pain and I had to study JavaScript as a separate subject, JavaScript is interesting, really interesting ...hope you understand, its power of programming in the web blew me up and I had to think of a library which.... yes as you guessed JQuery....  with this i made some useless but mind refreshing stuffs, check out my YouTube account for some of them, <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiSK2jvjFw9WfGhCYDzSq7g> ...\r\n\r\nLater I learned Ionic though for a short time, with xml and my web technologies i could put together an android app like a timetable that used Local Storage and different HTML5 APIs to do that magic I wanted it to do.... after some time I decided to learn CSS frameworks, as you again guessed I took Bootstrap, Materialize and Material lite, from there I started learning Angular Material, that was after I learned Polymer for quite a time, Angular Material is interesting and Fascinating and could not stop loving it,till tomorrow I'll keep studying that.....\r\n\r\nOn the Back-end I learned PHP in class, it was a good language but I just loved JavaScript so I had to study node.js which helped me in production, I had to learn python to substitute PHP which is what am doing up to date.........\r\n\r\n### Straight to the point   \r\nScience to me is an art, an art to play deep with our minds, how creative we are and how we can show\r\nthat creativity.\r\nAs a good artist I need to be creative, just like how other artists do, the musicians per say, have to put\r\nup to the top with new songs now and then, this reflects that all artists are to play creatively.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Life Projects.\r\nThe life project to me is to have a company (NaldyCodes) that will serve as the center of Computer Technicians, Software Developers, Network Administrators and Database Administrators..... Its primary goal is to provide Hosting services to other companies in Africa. \r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nEmail    --: naldydome@gmail.com\r\n\r\nFacebook --: Donald felician\r\n\r\n\r\nInstagram--: Donald_felician\r\n\r\n\r\nPhone    --: +255652441424\r\n",
